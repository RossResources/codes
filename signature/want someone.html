I want someone to hear me crying. I want them to hear me cry, and tell me everything will be okay. I want someone to pat me on the back, and tell me that it’s not my fault. Sometimes, I want to throw a tantrum. At a person, or at my fate. And tell them, “Stop it, already.” “Haven’t you done enough?” “Please, just spare me.”</span></div></td><td></td></table></div></center>
